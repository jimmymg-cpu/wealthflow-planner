🚀 WealthFlow Planner

WealthFlow Planner is a dynamic financial engine designed to help users bridge the gap between building security and achieving long-term wealth.

📅 Career Milestones: Integrated raise and bonus modeling (percentage or fixed dollar).

📱 Responsive Dashboard: High-performance UI optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.

☁️ Real-time Cloud Sync: Strategy data persists across devices via Firebase Firestore.

📈 Advanced Visuals: Interactive area charts powered by Recharts for clear trend analysis.
